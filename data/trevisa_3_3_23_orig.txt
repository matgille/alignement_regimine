Chapter XXIII In þis laste chapitre we wol trete som what of bataille of schippes; but it nedeþ not to abyde longe þere aboute, for manye kynges þat ben iseid of oþere manere batailles mowe helpe in batailles in schippes. 

And touchynge þat manere of figtynge, first it is to wetynge how a schip scholde be maad. For gif a schip is euel imaad, it is sone ilost by a litel asaillyng of enemyes. Panne as Vigesius seith, it is to wetyng þat treen and tymber of þe whiche a schip scholde be maad scholde not be ifeld in eche tyme of þe gere. For in March and in Auerel whan moche hemour is in treen, it is not good to feile treen of þe whiche a schip scholde be maad. But in Iule and in Agust oþer in som oþer tyme whanne þe humour in treen is fordryed, it is good to feile treen of þe whiche a schip scholde be maad. Also a schip scholde not be made of treen anoon as þei ben ifeld,  but first treen scholde be isawed and imaad bordes þerof and abyde a certeyne tyme þat þei mowe drye and clynge. For gif a schip is imaad of grene tymber, whanne þe kynde humour passeþ and failleþ, þe tymber schrynþek and maþeþ in þe schip chynes and cliftes and no kyng mowe be more perilous þan þat. And it is hard to taþe hede at ones to batailles of schippes and to putte hemself to peril lest þe schippe be broþe oþer sonk. For it is iknowe how schip tymber schulde be feld and be let abyde for to dryge and clynge for to maþe wel a schip þerof, it is to wetynge how in a schip so imaad a bataille scholde be geue. And touchynge som doynge a bataille of schippes haþ som manere doynge liehe to manere doynge of bataille of þe feld. For as in bataille of þe feld it nedeþ þat figtynge men be wel iarmed and cunne wel defende hemself fro stroþes and geuen enemyes sore stroþes and woundes, and so þis nedeþ in bataille of þe see. And also in suche figtynge it nedede þat men be betere iarmed þan in figtynge in londe. Panne for men þat figten in þe see stondeþ as it were ipigt and meuen but a lite þei mowe þe better bere heuy armer, wherfore here ärmere scholde be þe more heuy. But as it longeþ to þis doynge, we may reþene ten by þe whiche see figtynge men scholde assaylle here enemyes. þe firste is fuyre þat is icleped incendiarius. For it scholde haue wik hem manye vesselles ful of pich, of brymston, of roseyn, of oyle; and aile þes scholde be wrapped wik herdene. And þese vesselles  so ful scholde be isette afuyre and iþrowe in to þe schippe of enemyes. And þe vessel breþe and sette afuyre þe mater of þe brennynge and setteþ þe schip afuyre. And manye suche scholde be þrowe in to þe schip for to sette þe schip afuyre in manye places. And whanne suche thingges ben iþrowe, it is to doynge for to figte harde and sore wik þe schip men so þat þei mowe not a while quenche þe fuyre. þe seconde, buschements helpeþ moche in batailles of þe see. For as in þe lond ben isette boschementes of knygtes þat fallen and resen on enemyes vnwaar and affrayen hem and ouercomen hem sone, so in þe see byhynde som ilondes ben imaad boschementes so þat þe figtynge men breþen out and fallen on enemyes vnwaar and ouercome hem þe sonnere. þe þridde, in bataille of þe see it is to doynge þat þey þat sayllen haue alwey here schip in deep water and dryue þe schip of enemyes to þe clyfward; for þey þat ben idrawe to lond lesen þe rees of asayllynge. þe ferþe, to þe mast of þe schip scholde be honged a long tree iheled wik ire in eyþer ende for to smyte bothe schip and schip men, as þe instrument þat hatte þe wether smytek þe walles of a cyte þat is byseged. And þat tre scholde be ordeyned in þis wise so þat þe bond þat holdeþ it may be meued vpward and dounward, and so is þe more avantage for to smyte þenviþ boþe þe schippe and men þat ben þerinne. þe fifte, in bataille of schippes scholde be many brood arwes for to þerue þe sailles of enemyes and maþe  þerinne many greet holes and col slettes. For whanne in þe sailles ben many holes and slittes and mowe not holde wynd, þan þe enemyes mowe not holde ful cours for to smyte noþer mow sone flee gif þey wol wikdrawe out of þe bataille. þe sixte, schip men vse to haue a croþed ire as it were an hook ful scharp and þeruyng and þerueþ þenviþ anoon ropes þat holdeþ þe sailles. And whan þe sayles ben so iþet and þe maste ben ifalle, me wikdrawen fro þe enemyes so þat þei mowe not figte. For by suche kyttynge of saylles and of ropes þe schip is þe more slow and þe lasse mygty to figte. þe seuenþe, schip men vsen to haue strong yren croþes þat þei mowe, whanne þey ben among enemyes, wik þilþe croþes taþe here schippes þat þei mowe not passe awey þeig þei wolde. þe eigte, in bataille of schippes þis cautel scholde be knowe, þat þei scholde haue manye vessels ful of whigt lyme oþer of chalk þat schold be þrowe fro hiyg place in to schippes of enemyes. And whanne þei ben stronglich iþrowe and ibroþe, pouder ariseþ, as we seide tofore in bataille in londe, and comeþ in to þe eygen of enemyes and greueþ hem so þat þei ben as it were iblynded and mowe not see. And þat is ful perelous in bataille of schippes, for in suche a bataille figtyng men ben in peril of deeþ in eche side. Wherfore gif eyen of figtynge men in suche a bataille ben so igreued wik poudre of lyme oþer of chalþe so þat þei mowe not isee, þei mowe ligtliche be spilde of here enemyes oþer adreynt in þe see. þe nynþe cautel is to haue manye vessels ful of nesche soope þat scholde be strongliche iþrowe in to þe schippes of enemyes, and þat on þe place in þe whiche þe enemyes stonden inne to defende þe schippes. For whanne þilþe vessels ben ibroþe, þilþe places ben imaad so slidere by nesche sope þat whanne enemyes setten here feet þerinne anon þey fallen in to þe see. þe tenþe is as it were worst of alle. For som schip men mowe dure longe vnder water, þanne schip men scholde ordeyne som what agenst þe schip of enemyes and sende oon byhynde pryueiliche þat may longe abyde vnder water and maþe hooles wik a gymelot oþer with an augeer in þe schip of enemyes in þe neþer side, and maþe manye hooles þerinne þat þe enemyes may not fynde. And whanne moche water comeþ in at þilþe hooles, þe enemyes ben ilost and þe schip also. Also it is to wetyng þat in a bataille of schippes scholde be manye stoones and manye scharpe ires þat may be þrowe riʒt as stones wik þe whiche enemyes ben soone igreued. But þer ben so manye suche particuler doynges þat þei mowe not alle be ireþened. Panne ben þer cautels inowe þat we hauen itauʒt touchinge batailles of schippes. For it is declared how treen and tymber scholde be feld of þe whiche schippes scholde be maad and how me scholde fiʒte in batailles of schippes, it is to doynge þat we declare wherto aile batailles ben iordeyned. Panne it is to wetyng, as þe philosofer meneþ, þat we werryeth not for to haue werre but for to haue pees. And bataille and werre may be ordeyned of malice of men, and by coueityse for to haue wynnynge, oþer wreche for wrathe, oþer som likynge. But netful batailles ben iordeyned for pees and quyete of men and for þe comune profit, for batailles scholde be among men as drenches and blood letynge in þe bodye of mankynde. For in þe bodye of man ben manye humours, so among men ben manye persones and manye men. And as while þe humours ben accordynge in þe bodye vs nedeþ noþer drenche ne bledyng while þer is no passyng of humours, so while men beren hem wel and non doþ oþer wrong scholde no werre be noþer bataille. Wherfore as by bledynge and by drenches superfluyte of humours is iþrowe out þe whiche superfluyte letteþ heele of þe body, so by batailles enemyes scholde be bore adoon and isleyne þat leiten þe comune profit and pees of citeseynes and of hem þat ben in þe regne. Panne gif kynges and princes hauen riʒtful werre and bataille and ʒif here enemyes disturblen wrongfulliche þe pees and þe comyn profit, it is not inconuenyent to teche hem al maner fiʒtynge of bataille and al maner doynge by þe whiche þei mow ouercome here enemyes. And al suche doynge þei scholde ordeyne for þe comyn profit and for pees of citeseyns. For gif þei desiren þe comyn profit and pees of þe citeseyns, þei schulle haue þat perpetual pees in þe whiche is cheef quiete and reste - þe whiche pees God graunteþ and byhotek to his owne trewe seruantes þat is iblessed for eueremore. Amen.
