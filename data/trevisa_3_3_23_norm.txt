Chapter XXIII In this laste chapitre we wol trete som what of bataille of schippes; but it nedeth not to abyde longe there aboute, for manye kynges that ben iseid of othere manere batailles mowe helpe in batailles in schippes. 

And touchynge that manere of figtynge, first it is to wetynge how a schip scholde be maad. For gif a schip is euel imaad, it is sone ilost by a litel asaillyng of enemyes. Panne as Vigesius seith, it is to wetyng that treen and tymber of the whiche a schip scholde be maad scholde not be ifeld in eche tyme of the gere. For in March and in Auerel whan moche hemour is in treen, it is not good to feile treen of the whiche a schip scholde be maad. But in Iule and in Agust other in som other tyme whanne the humour in treen is fordryed, it is good to feile treen of the whiche a schip scholde be maad. Also a schip scholde not be made of treen anoon as thei ben ifeld,  but first treen scholde be isawed and imaad bordes therof and abyde a certeyne tyme that thei mowe drye and clynge. For gif a schip is imaad of grene tymber, whanne the kynde humour passeth and failleth, the tymber schrynthek and matheth in the schip chynes and cliftes and no kyng mowe be more perilous than that. And it is hard to tathe hede at ones to batailles of schippes and to putte hemself to peril lest the schippe be brothe other sonk. For it is iknowe how schip tymber schulde be feld and be let abyde for to dryge and clynge for to mathe wel a schip therof, it is to wetynge how in a schip so imaad a bataille scholde be geue. And touchynge som doynge a bataille of schippes hath som manere doynge liehe to manere doynge of bataille of the feld. For as in bataille of the feld it nedeth that figtynge men be wel iarmed and cunne wel defende hemself fro strothes and geuen enemyes sore strothes and woundes, and so this nedeth in bataille of the see. And also in suche figtynge it nedede that men be betere iarmed than in figtynge in londe. Panne for men that figten in the see stondeth as it were ipigt and meuen but a lite thei mowe the better bere heuy armer, wherfore here ärmere scholde be the more heuy. But as it longeth to this doynge, we may rethene ten by the whiche see figtynge men scholde assaylle here enemyes. the firste is fuyre that is icleped incendiarius. For it scholde haue wik hem manye vesselles ful of pich, of brymston, of roseyn, of oyle; and aile thes scholde be wrapped wik herdene. And these vesselles  so ful scholde be isette afuyre and ithrowe in to the schippe of enemyes. And the vessel brethe and sette afuyre the mater of the brennynge and setteth the schip afuyre. And manye suche scholde be throwe in to the schip for to sette the schip afuyre in manye places. And whanne suche thingges ben ithrowe, it is to doynge for to figte harde and sore wik the schip men so that thei mowe not a while quenche the fuyre. the seconde, buschements helpeth moche in batailles of the see. For as in the lond ben isette boschementes of knygtes that fallen and resen on enemyes vnwaar and affrayen hem and ouercomen hem sone, so in the see byhynde som ilondes ben imaad boschementes so that the figtynge men brethen out and fallen on enemyes vnwaar and ouercome hem the sonnere. the thridde, in bataille of the see it is to doynge that they that sayllen haue alwey here schip in deep water and dryue the schip of enemyes to the clyfward; for they that ben idrawe to lond lesen the rees of asayllynge. the ferthe, to the mast of the schip scholde be honged a long tree iheled wik ire in eyther ende for to smyte bothe schip and schip men, as the instrument that hatte the wether smytek the walles of a cyte that is byseged. And that tre scholde be ordeyned in this wise so that the bond that holdeth it may be meued vpward and dounward, and so is the more avantage for to smyte thenvith bothe the schippe and men that ben therinne. the fifte, in bataille of schippes scholde be many brood arwes for to therue the sailles of enemyes and mathe  therinne many greet holes and col slettes. For whanne in the sailles ben many holes and slittes and mowe not holde wynd, than the enemyes mowe not holde ful cours for to smyte nother mow sone flee gif they wol wikdrawe out of the bataille. the sixte, schip men vse to haue a crothed ire as it were an hook ful scharp and theruyng and therueth thenvith anoon ropes that holdeth the sailles. And whan the sayles ben so ithet and the maste ben ifalle, me wikdrawen fro the enemyes so that thei mowe not figte. For by suche kyttynge of saylles and of ropes the schip is the more slow and the lasse mygty to figte. the seuenthe, schip men vsen to haue strong yren crothes that thei mowe, whanne they ben among enemyes, wik thilthe crothes tathe here schippes that thei mowe not passe awey theig thei wolde. the eigte, in bataille of schippes this cautel scholde be knowe, that thei scholde haue manye vessels ful of whigt lyme other of chalk that schold be throwe fro hiyg place in to schippes of enemyes. And whanne thei ben stronglich ithrowe and ibrothe, pouder ariseth, as we seide tofore in bataille in londe, and cometh in to the eygen of enemyes and greueth hem so that thei ben as it were iblynded and mowe not see. And that is ful perelous in bataille of schippes, for in suche a bataille figtyng men ben in peril of deeth in eche side. Wherfore gif eyen of figtynge men in suche a bataille ben so igreued wik poudre of lyme other of chalthe so that thei mowe not isee, thei mowe ligtliche be spilde of here enemyes other adreynt in the see. the nynthe cautel is to haue manye vessels ful of nesche soope that scholde be strongliche ithrowe in to the schippes of enemyes, and that on the place in the whiche the enemyes stonden inne to defende the schippes. For whanne thilthe vessels ben ibrothe, thilthe places ben imaad so slidere by nesche sope that whanne enemyes setten here feet therinne anon they fallen in to the see. the tenthe is as it were worst of alle. For som schip men mowe dure longe vnder water, thanne schip men scholde ordeyne som what agenst the schip of enemyes and sende oon byhynde pryueiliche that may longe abyde vnder water and mathe hooles wik a gymelot other with an augeer in the schip of enemyes in the nether side, and mathe manye hooles therinne that the enemyes may not fynde. And whanne moche water cometh in at thilthe hooles, the enemyes ben ilost and the schip also. Also it is to wetyng that in a bataille of schippes scholde be manye stoones and manye scharpe ires that may be throwe riʒt as stones wik the whiche enemyes ben soone igreued. But ther ben so manye suche particuler doynges that thei mowe not alle be irethened. Panne ben ther cautels inowe that we hauen itauʒt touchinge batailles of schippes. For it is declared how treen and tymber scholde be feld of the whiche schippes scholde be maad and how me scholde fiʒte in batailles of schippes, it is to doynge that we declare wherto aile batailles ben iordeyned. Panne it is to wetyng, as the philosofer meneth, that we werryeth not for to haue werre but for to haue pees. And bataille and werre may be ordeyned of malice of men, and by coueityse for to haue wynnynge, other wreche for wrathe, other som likynge. But netful batailles ben iordeyned for pees and quyete of men and for the comune profit, for batailles scholde be among men as drenches and blood letynge in the bodye of mankynde. For in the bodye of man ben manye humours, so among men ben manye persones and manye men. And as while the humours ben accordynge in the bodye vs nedeth nother drenche ne bledyng while ther is no passyng of humours, so while men beren hem wel and non doth other wrong scholde no werre be nother bataille. Wherfore as by bledynge and by drenches superfluyte of humours is ithrowe out the whiche superfluyte letteth heele of the body, so by batailles enemyes scholde be bore adoon and isleyne that leiten the comune profit and pees of citeseynes and of hem that ben in the regne. Panne gif kynges and princes hauen riʒtful werre and bataille and ʒif here enemyes disturblen wrongfulliche the pees and the comyn profit, it is not inconuenyent to teche hem al maner fiʒtynge of bataille and al maner doynge by the whiche thei mow ouercome here enemyes. And al suche doynge thei scholde ordeyne for the comyn profit and for pees of citeseyns. For gif thei desiren the comyn profit and pees of the citeseyns, thei schulle haue that perpetual pees in the whiche is cheef quiete and reste - the whiche pees God graunteth and byhotek to his owne trewe seruantes that is iblessed for eueremore. Amen.
